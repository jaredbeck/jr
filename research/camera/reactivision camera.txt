The reacTIVision application is available for the following operating
systems: Windows, MacOS X and Linux. Under Windows it supports any
camera with a proper WDM driver, such as USB, USB2, FireWire and DV
cameras. Equally under MacOS X all FireWire cameras and any camera
supported by QuickTime will work in reacTIVision. Under Linux, FireWire
cameras are best supported, as well as a few Video4Linux and
Video4Linux2 USB cameras. 

illumination

For the tracking, the objects need to be properly illuminated, so the
camera and thus the computer vision application can see them correctly.
For the projection onto a table, the surface needs to be dark though, so
the user can see the projected image well enough. Since these two
necessary steps logically exclude each other, the solution is to operate
in two different spectra: The projection has to be visible to the user,
so the computer vision component needs to operate in a different,
invisible spectrum such as infrared. Most CCD cameras are perfectly
sensitive within the near IR spectrum, therefore infrared LED lamps can
be used to illuminate the table. All light from the visible spectrum
needs to be filtered in the camera, so the computer vision algorithm is
not disturbed by the projection. Eventually an existing infrared blocker
needs to be removed from the camera sensor. 

camera

In general cameras with CCD sensors should perform better than those
with a CMOS chip. Additionally you should make sure that the camera has
an acceptable lens. These two criterias basically exclude cameras below
the 50$ range. DV cameras supporting full-frame mode are suitable, while
those with interlaced mode only, will not work at all. For lowest
latency and best performance we recommend firewire cameras from the top
range, such as industrial cameras with a high framerate, resolution and
sensor size. These cameras usually also come with high quality lenses.
Cheaper firewire cameras, such as the unibrain fire-i also allow
optional wide-angle lenses.

Unibrain Fire-i
Great in low-light; compact; additional FireWire port.
Mediocre color accuracy and picture quality.
$99

Orange Micro iBot Standard
Great picture quality.
Bulky; hard to position at eye-level; poor OS X software bundle.
$99

ADS Technologies Pyro 1394 WebCam
Great picture quality; best software bundle.
Bulky; hard to position at eye-level.
$109

Apple Computer iSight
Excellent picture quality; built-in mike; fantastic industrial design; best for “face-to-face” chatting.
Performs poorly in low-light; no additional software.
$149

Apple iSight, Philips SPC900NC and Logitech QuickCam Pro 4000 are
pretty safe bets. Loads of other cameras work as well as long as you've
downloaded a driver from http://webcam-osx.sourceforge.net. See the list
of cameras that work (and those that don't) with Macs.
